# Video Switcher

## Idea
Initially i wanted something which helps to switch video source on bandwidth changes without setting up HLS.

## How
It contains three parts:
- videoSwitcher
- BrowserFormats
- HostedFiles

### videoSwitcher
Is changing source on bandwidth changes

### BrowserFormats
Checks by codec what is supported by client

### HostedFiles
Checks what is available on server. Produces console output
